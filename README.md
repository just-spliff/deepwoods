# Deepwoods

Deepwoods is a family of forest-inspired dark themes for Visual Studio Code.  
It focuses on calm, natural palettes, crisp contrast and a minimal, Vesper-like syntax style.

> ℹ️ Note  
> Deepwoods is **inspired by the excellent Vesper theme for VS Code**, but uses its own custom color palettes and token configuration.

- _italics optional_

  - Regular themes keep everything upright.
