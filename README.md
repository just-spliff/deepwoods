# Frosty Pine

Frosty Pine is a minimalist dark theme for Visual Studio Code with a pine–forest twist.  
It focuses on calm, green-tinted neutrals, crisp contrast, and a clean syntax style that stays out of your way.

> ⚠️ Note  
> Frosty Pine is **inspired by the excellent _Vesper_ theme for VS Code**, but all colors have been reworked into a green / white / grey palette to match the “Frosty Pine” aesthetic.
